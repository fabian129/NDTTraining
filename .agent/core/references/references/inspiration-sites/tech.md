insane scroll animation site, futuristic, AI theme

**What I like**: Extremely cute, character-driven 3D narrative.
**Technique**: "On-Rails" Scrollytelling. Heavily optimized 3D scenes (likely baked animations or highly efficient glTF) triggered by scroll progress. Different from Immersive Garden's "abstract/atmospheric" style; this is "narrative/character" style.
