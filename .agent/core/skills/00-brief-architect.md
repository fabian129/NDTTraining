name: brief-architect
description: Project intake and strategic planning skill. Takes raw client data (meetings, documents, playbooks, existing sites, templates) and produces a complete project blueprint with downstream briefs for every skill in the pipeline. Also generates client-facing brand documentation. Use this skill at the START of every new project, when onboarding a new client, when receiving client documents/playbooks, when the user says "new project", "new client", "plan this", "brief this", or provides meeting notes and client materials. This skill runs BEFORE everything else in the pipeline.

# Brief Architect

## Objective
Transform raw client chaos into structured, actionable project documentation. This skill is the bridge between "the client sent us a bunch of stuff" and "the agent knows exactly what to build."

## Philosophy
**Not:** "Let me start coding based on these meeting notes."
**Instead:** "Let me understand the client's world first, then create a blueprint that every skill can execute on."

Clients rarely have their brand documented. Meeting notes are messy. Playbooks are long. The Brief Architect reads everything, asks the right questions, and produces two things:
1. **Internal briefs** that the agent pipeline consumes
2. **Client-facing documentation** that the client can keep, share, and use beyond this project

---

## When to Run
- Start of every new project
- When onboarding a new client
- When receiving a batch of client documents
- When pivoting an existing project based on new information
- When creating a demo/pitch site for a prospect

---

## Inputs (What You Might Receive)

The skill must handle any combination of these. Sometimes all of them, sometimes just one.

| Input Type | Examples | What to Extract |
|:-----------|:---------|:----------------|
| **Meeting notes** | Fathom summaries, call transcripts, action items | Goals, decisions, tone of voice, priorities |
| **Client documents** | Playbooks, ICPs, pricing docs, audit frameworks | Service structure, target audience, terminology, value proposition |
| **Existing site** | URL or screenshot of current/draft site | What works, what's missing, current positioning |
| **Aura template** | HTML file from Aura.build | Existing sections, visual direction, gaps to fill |
| **Reference sites** | URLs or screenshots the client likes | Aesthetic preferences, layout patterns, feature expectations |
| **Verbal brief** | "Build a site for an event agency" | Starting point — requires more questions |
| **Brand assets** | Logos, color preferences, font preferences | Visual constraints |

### Handling Sparse Input
If you receive very little (just a verbal brief or a single document):
1. Make reasonable assumptions based on industry and business type
2. Mark every assumption clearly: `[ASSUMPTION — verify with client]`
3. Present assumptions in the brief for approval before proceeding
4. Don't ask 20 questions upfront — assume smartly, verify later

### Handling Dense Input
If you receive a lot (10+ documents, long meeting notes, multiple playbooks):
1. Read everything before producing anything
2. Don't summarize each document separately — synthesize across all of them
3. Look for contradictions between documents and flag them
4. Identify what's relevant to the website vs what's internal business documentation

---

## Phase 1: Ingest & Understand

### Step 1: Read Everything
Consume all provided materials. Don't start producing output yet. Build a mental model of:
- What does this business do?
- Who do they sell to?
- What's their unique positioning?
- What language do they use? (Their words, not generic marketing speak)
- What are they trying to achieve with this website?
- What exists already?

### Step 2: Identify the Project Type

| Type | Characteristics | Approach |
|:-----|:----------------|:---------|
| **Full build from scratch** | No existing site, client has documents/brief | Full blueprint, design direction needed |
| **Template-based build** | Aura template or reference site as starting point | Gap analysis: what template has vs what client needs |
| **Rebuild/redesign** | Existing site that needs improvement | Audit existing, preserve what works, fix what doesn't |
| **Demo/pitch site** | Building to sell to a prospect, not a signed client | Fast, impressive, use Sandbox Mode, less documentation |
| **Expansion** | Adding pages/sections to existing project | Read existing DNA, plan additions only |

### Step 3: Extract Core Elements

From all the input, extract these:

**Business Identity**
```
Company:        [Name]
Industry:       [Specific niche, not just "consulting"]
Positioning:    [How they describe themselves — use THEIR words]
USP:            [What makes them different from competitors]
```

Tier 3:         [Premium level]
...
```

**Conversion Goals**

Secondary:      [Secondary action — download, subscribe, explore]
Funnel:         [How they get from visitor → customer]
```

**Voice & Tone**
```
Personality:    [ex. "Authoritative but approachable", "Bold and direct"]
Keywords:       [Words they use repeatedly — "Executive Architecture", "EBITDA-skydd"]
Avoid:          [Words/tone they'd never use]
Register:       [Formal / Professional / Casual / Technical]
```

**Existing Assets**
```
Logo:           [Yes/No, format]
Colors:         [If specified]
Fonts:          [If specified]
Photography:    [Style preference, existing images]
Content:        [Blog posts, case studies, testimonials available?]

## Phase 2: Produce the Blueprint

## Phase 3: Break Down to Skill Briefs

After the user approves the Project Brief, generate these files:

### File Structure

## Phase 4: Brand Bible (Client-Facing)

This is the deliverable the client keeps. It's written for humans, not agents. Professional tone, clean formatting, no internal jargon.

Generate this AFTER Design Director has run and `active-dna.md` is populated.

## Phase 5: Handoff to Pipeline

After all briefs are generated and approved:

1. **If design direction is clear** → Skip Design Director, go straight to Page Planner with `page-plan.md`
2. **If design direction needs exploration** → Design Director reads `design-direction.md` and proposes options
3. **Copywriter** reads `copy-brief.md` and produces copy BEFORE layout begins
4. **Component Architect** reads `tech-spec.md` for any functional requirements
5. **All skills** reference `project-brief.md` as the source of truth for client context

### Integration with Existing Pipeline

```
Brief Architect (NEW — runs first)
    ↓ produces briefs
Design Director ← reads design-direction.md
    ↓
Page Planner ← reads page-plan.md
    ↓
Copywriter ← reads copy-brief.md
    ↓
[Rest of pipeline as normal]
```

### Integration with Aura Migration

If starting from an Aura template:
1. Brief Architect produces the blueprint
2. Aura Migration converts the template
3. Brief Architect's `section-suggestions.md` identifies gaps
4. Agent adds missing sections using the normal pipeline
5. Copywriter replaces template copy with client-specific copy from `copy-brief.md`

## Cross-Skill References

| When... | Hand off to... |
|:--------|:---------------|
| Design direction needs exploration | **Design Director** with `design-direction.md` |
| Page structure is defined | **Page Planner** with `page-plan.md` |
| Copy needs writing | **Copywriter** with `copy-brief.md` |
| Technical features identified | **Component Architect** with `tech-spec.md` |
| Aura template is starting point | **Aura Migration** + section suggestions |
| Brand Bible needs visual data | Wait for **Design Director** to populate `active-dna.md` first |

## Key Principles

1. **Read everything before producing anything.** Don't start writing the brief after reading the first document.
2. **Use the client's language.** If they say "EBITDA-skydd", you write "EBITDA-skydd", not "financial protection."
3. **Suggest what they missed.** Clients don't know what sections a website needs. You do.
4. **Mark assumptions clearly.** If you're guessing, say so. Let the user verify.
5. **One approval gate.** The Project Brief is the single checkpoint. After that, the pipeline runs.
6. **The Brand Bible is a deliverable.** It's not internal documentation — it's something the client pays for and keeps.
